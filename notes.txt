        Hello! I'm Anas Alakkad, a dedicated Software Engineer with a
        deep-rooted passion for coding and innovation. My journey in
        software development took a definitive turn in my final
        semester at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona,
        when I realized my true calling lay in software, more than in
        hardware.

        My academic background in Computer Engineering, highlighted by
        a GPA of 3.62, laid a strong foundation in both hardware and
        software realms. While I delved into C++ and microcontroller
        programming—developing sensor systems, digital clocks, and
        even a game called “Game of Life”—I found myself increasingly
        drawn towards the intricacies of software development.

        Beyond my technical prowess, my role as a Transportation
        Manager at Ceravo Care honed my leadership skills and
        operational efficiency. This blend of technical expertise,
        managerial experience, and a continuous drive for learning
        positions me uniquely in the field of software engineering.

        In my free time, I engage in diverse activities such as DIY projects,
        hiking, and reading. These hobbies not only offer me a creative outlet
        but also sharpen my problem-solving skills.
        They provide a balance that enhances my perspective and approach in the
        field of software engineering.
